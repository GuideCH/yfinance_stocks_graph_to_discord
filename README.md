# yfinance_stocks_graph_bot_discord
this bot will pull plot price from yfinance to discord

### how to use:

changes TOKENS in bot.py and it's yours

### pros

moddable:

you can use yfinance to get other data
and plot it not just plot ['Adj Closed'] you can even get dividend info and other financial staement information to report it in discord
you can even use your knowledge to make it better like graph edit , add indicator , real time analysis, price prediction or so
just add more function in data visualization

support more stonks and commodities:

as long as it in yahoofinance (almost all of it in)
Example YGG (.bk) stonk not support in Alpha but support if you use this bot WOOHOO!!!

### cons

graph and interface:

it'll not be as beautiful as Alpha bot that use other data source (but if you're skilled enough you can mixed python image edit to make it a lot more beautiful well i'm trying)
and if you want to plot indicator you need to do the indicator math by yourself
example calculate sma (simple moving average)
that's the hard partn, plotting it? E A S Y

prefix:

hard to edit cuz i don't know discord have (prefix = x)
you can fix that by yourself btw and discord I'll only support / commands soon but for small scale use this'll do just fine

### for non programmer

search how to get discord bot tokens
and put that tokens inside ('TOKENS')
at some codeline in bot.py
when you run it run bot.py

you can deploy it in replit too
but seacrh how to do that yourself it's pretty easy tho

### - ภาษาไทย

เอาโทเคนบอทไปใส่ใน ('TOKENS') ที่ bot.py
ส่วนโทคเคนบอท ไปหาเอาในกูเกิ้ลแล้วกันว่าเอามายังไง
